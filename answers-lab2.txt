    Entry	Base Virtual Address	Points to (logically):
    1023	0xffc00000	            Page table for top 4MB of phys memory
    1022	0xff800000              Page table

3. All the Kernel's Data was put above KERNBASE,where the address permission was set kernel RW, user NONE.
4. This operating system can support 4 Gig physical memory at most,for the page dir has 1024 enrties,
    each of it can point to a page table ,which has 1024 enrties too.As the page size is set as 4K,
    the total amount of physical memory is 4 Gig.
5. 4100k,including 1024 page tables,and 1 page directory.
6. After the instruction "jmp relocated",the system start running at an EIP above KERNBASE.for the page 
    system also map virtual address 0-4M,to physic memory 0-4M. After paging turned on,the next instructions
    helps to switch above KERNBASE,are still work in low memory.
